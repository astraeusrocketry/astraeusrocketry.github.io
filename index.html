    <h1>Welcome to Astraeus!</h1>
    <h2>We are a new team based out of Poolesville High School participating in the American Rocketry Challenge.</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Make divs have frosted glass background -->
    <h3>The Goal:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Payload:</strong> Design a rocket that cradles two sideways oriented eggs</li>
        <li><strong>Altitude Goal:</strong> Aim for an altitude of exactly 790 feet</li>
        <li><strong>Flight Time:</strong> Safely return to Earth within the range of 41 to 44 seconds</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Our Plan:</h3>
    <!-- TODO: Section this paragraph -->
    <p>
        Create an actively guided rocket that uses four fins to steer and brake the rocket to the precise altitude. The
        airframe will be 3D printed, composite, and will be light and rigid, providing a safe ascent and descent for the
        payload. For descent control, our rocket will feature a reefed parachute design to allow us incredible authority
        over our sink rate, ultimately allowing us to flawlessly land the vehicle after flight. All of this will be
        controlled with off-the-shelf flight computers running software specifically designed around simulations. These
        simulations will calculate aerodynamic forces on the aircraft during flight.
