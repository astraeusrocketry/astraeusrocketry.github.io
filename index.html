    <h1>Welcome to Astraeus!</h1>

        We are building an actively guided rocket to compete in the American Rocketry Challenge (ARC). Our plan is to
        use an actively guided rocket using four fins to steer and brake the rocket to the precise altitude that will
        achieve victory. The airframe will be 3d printed and composite and will be light and rigid providing a safe
        ascent and descent for the payload. For descent control, our rocket will feature a reefed parachute design to
        allow us incredible authority over our sink rate allowing us to flawlessly land the vehicle after flight.
        All of this will be controlled with off-the-shelf flight computers running custom software designed around
        simulations that we ran to calculate aerodynamic forces on the aircraft in flight.
