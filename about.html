    <h3>Our Plan:</h3>
    <!-- TODO: Section this paragraph -->
    <p>
      Create an actively guided rocket that uses four fins to steer and brake
      the rocket to the precise altitude. The airframe will be 3D printed,
      composite, and will be light and rigid, providing a safe ascent and
      descent for the payload. For descent control, our rocket will feature a
      reefed parachute design to allow us incredible authority over our sink
      rate, ultimately allowing us to flawlessly land the vehicle after flight.
      All of this will be controlled with off-the-shelf flight computers running
      software specifically designed around simulations. These simulations will
      calculate aerodynamic forces on the aircraft during flight.
